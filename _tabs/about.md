## Introduction

I am a cybersecurity an intelligent networks engineering student deeply immersed in the intricate worlds of cybersecurity and network infrastructures. My passion lies in dissecting how systems function at their core. This blog serves as my personal laboratory and a platform to document my journey, and share insights. I thrive on understanding the 'why' behind every 'how', constantly pushing the boundaries of my technical comprehension.

## My Work Philosophy

Security, to me, is more about deeply understanding systems before protecting them. As an engineering student, I try to approach every challenge with the mindset of an attacker and the rigor of a builder.
